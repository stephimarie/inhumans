## Description:

Inhuman Murder mystery party game for 1-5 players.  What a fun way to play with friends or solo set the scene in 1 of 5 planets. You can choose your Character actor or create your own.  When the user clicks on the planet, a pop-up window will deploy to have you select the Character actor, and then when all 5 players have entered the game it begins. 

Our focus was to offer a fun twist to the traditional murder Mystery and connect with your friends, it's simple and user friendly. We especially wanted to reach a broad audience and be age-inclusive and accessible. We thought even those that don't know of the Inhumans characters could identifiable with at least one or create their own.
